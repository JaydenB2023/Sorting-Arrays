# Sorting-Arrays

Create an array of size 100 and read in the numbers from nums.txt. Use bubble sort, insertion sort, or selection sort to sort the array. After the array is sorted, implement your own binary search algorithm to find the number 42. Your output file should show the following IN ORDER:

"It took ??? attempts to find the number 42" (replace ??? with the actual number of iterations your binary search took)
two newlines
your sorted array, in the format 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, etc. (this includes the commas and spaces, and no new lines are necessary)
